# CPUScheduling

This project implements core CPU scheduling algorithms using Python.  
It was developed as part of an Operating Systems assignment to understand how different scheduling methods affect process performance.

## ⏱️ Algorithms Implemented
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**

The program calculates and displays:
- Waiting Time
- Turnaround Time
- Execution Order

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python CPUScheduling.py
