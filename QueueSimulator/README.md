# QueueSimulator

This project is a queueing system simulation built using MATLAB.  
It was created to explore concepts of service flow and wait time modeling.

## 🔁 Features
- Simulates basic queue operations
- Models service line behavior and wait time
- Designed with academic/learning focus

## 💡 Educational Purpose
This project was part of coursework involving simulation or systems modeling.  
It demonstrates how queueing logic can be visualized and tested using MATLAB scripting.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the `.m` file in MATLAB
2. Run the script
3. Observe the simulation output and results

## 🧠 Concepts Involved
- FIFO queue behavior
- Service time vs wait time
- Flow control and process simulation

## 📁 Folder Contents
- `.m` file(s) containing the simulation logic
- Possible example test cases or configuration
