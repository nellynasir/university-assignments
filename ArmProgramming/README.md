# ArmProgramming

This project simulates low-level programming logic for controlling a robotic arm.  
It was developed for our Embedded Systems or Mechatronics-related coursework.

## ü§ñ Features
- Control logic for robotic arm movement
- Time delay implementation for motion simulation
- Basic I/O operations and LED control (if on board)

## üí° Educational Focus
- Manual movement sequencing
- Low-level programming syntax
- Simulated control through register-style logic

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
If connected to a microcontroller:
1. Load source code via IDE like Keil or MPLAB
2. Flash it to the board
3. Use button inputs or sensors to test movement

**Note:** If no board is used, code is provided for simulation/study purposes.
