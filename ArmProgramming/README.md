# ArmProgramming

This project demonstrates low-level control logic for a robotic arm using ARM Assembly (`.s` files).  
It was developed for coursework related to Embedded Systems or Mechatronics.

## ü§ñ Features
- Movement sequencing using low-level register logic
- Time delay simulation
- I/O control (e.g., LEDs, motors)

## üí° Educational Focus
- Manual motor control using assembly
- Understanding low-level CPU operations
- Register-based movement programming

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
If working with actual hardware:
1. Open the `.s` files in Keil or compatible IDE
2. Flash to a supported ARM development board
3. Use input/output pins to control behavior

**Note:** Code is also suitable for review/simulation purposes without hardware.
